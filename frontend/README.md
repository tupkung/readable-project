# Readable Project

This is my final project for Udacity's Redux course. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## Running the project

To get start right way:

* Install and start the API server
  - `cd api-server`
  - `npm install`
  - `node server.js`
* In another terminal window, run the front-end
  - `cd frontend`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`
